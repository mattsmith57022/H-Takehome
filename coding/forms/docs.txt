For this design, my goal was to keep it simple and extensible. The tables are straightforward. The interesting part is how the forms and submissions are stored. I decided on storing the entire structure in JSON. For example: 
{
  "title": "Health Check",
  "elements": [
    {
      "id": "current_weight",
      "type": "number",
      "label": "Current Weight",
      "required": true,
      "min": 20,
      "max": 300
    },
    {
      "id": "stress_level",
      "type": "select",
      "label": "Current Stress Level",
      "options": [
        {"value": "low", "label": "Low"},
        {"value": "medium", "label": "Medium"},
        {"value": "high", "label": "High"}
      ],
      "required": true
    }
  ]
}

This allows additional elements to be added without schema updates which can be expensive on large tables.

The responses are similar. Here is an example JSON for the form above:
{
  "current_weight": 75,
  "stress_level": "medium"
}
